Data comes from [Gallup World Poll](https://worldhappiness.report/).

Project files:

- world-happiness-models.ipynb
  - Models predicting whether a country has a happiness rating of "Very High", "High", "Average", "Low", or "Very Low". 
  - SVM had the best performance.

Data comes from [Chowdhury et al.'s 2020 study, “Can AI help in screening Viral and COVID-19 pneumonia?”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9144185):

Project files:

- covid19-xray-models.ipynb
  - Neural network models predicting whether an X-ray image is "Covid-19", "Normal", or "Pneumonia"
  - The best performing models were the Sequential and ResNet neural network models. Both received **96% on all metric fields**, including accuracy, f1-score, precision, and recall.
